## 🧗‍♂️ Key Technical Challenges

<!-- content goes below -->

1. User authentication & authorization:
   None of us have experience with account creation and safely storing sensitive information like passwords.

2. Confirming “gifts”:
   For safety and spam prevention purposes, it doesn’t feel right to have a simple “buy” button like on a shopping site. Since all the items are free, it is very easy for 1 person to claim all the items. Adding functionality so that the process is intuitive and keeps users from meeting up with people that they don’t want to and limiting bot activity feels like a difficult question to answer.

3. Chat functionality:
   A solution to the above problem is a chat system where both the giver and recipient arrange pickup and both parties have to consent for an item to be claimed.

## 🏋🏽 Extension Opportunities

<!-- content goes below -->

1. Chat and two-way “purchase” consent:

- Users can arrange the details of giving/receiving an item.
- Users can also feel safer and more confident in giving away their items. Having two-way consent is more difficult to build out, but it would enhance the user experience.

2. Dark mode:

- Improves accessibility and quality of life, users can have an interface that they like more

3. Filters:

- Being able to narrow down items by location/distance, item type, keywords, etc.

4. Free services/events:

- Many buy-nothing groups also offer services and volunteer efforts in the community.

5. ISO (In Search Of) tab:

- Users can post items they are looking for
