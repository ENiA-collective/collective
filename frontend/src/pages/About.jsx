      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>Collective is a no-buy group application that provides an interface for users to look up clothes they no longer need for free exchange. 
        It will help users meet needs, promote mutual aid, help people connect with their community, and reduce environmental waste caused by overproduction.</p>
      <p>The product will provide an interface and act as a homebase to help people in urban areas to look up items by category (clothes etc) and post listings for items they no longer need in a no-buy fashion.
         This will allow people to meet their needs more affordably, connect with their neighbors, and reduce waste.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>The global apparel industry significantly contributes to both environmental degradation and social injustice, primarily fueled by the fast fashion business model. 
        This model is characterized by the rapid production and distribution of inexpensive clothing, leading to severe environmental impacts. 
        A leading percentage of these garments ultimately end up in landfills, including many that are donated to second-hand stores but never reused. 
        Additionally, the production processes tied to fast fashion heavily exploit workers, often severely underpaying them in order to maintain low costs. 
        This not only exacerbates poverty and limits economic opportunities in developing nations but also contributes to broader social inequalities.</p>
      <h3>Inadequate Solutions and Market Gaps</h3>
      <p>Existing platforms and apps that promote textile reuse and recycling often lack accessibility and ease of use. 
        They may also be cluttered with advertisements or politically motivated content, which can detract from the user experience and undermine the focus on sustainability and community aid. 
        This creates a gap in the market for a centralized solution that addresses environmental concerns and fosters a sense of community and mutual aid through a user-friendly, transparent, and engaging platform.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>The US is one of the leading contributors to textile waste, producing 17 million tons annually. 
        Of that, only 15% of this gets recycled, with the rest going to a landfill (66%) or being burned (19%).
         7% of global landfill space is dedicated purely to textiles. 
         The clothing sent to landfills is often in domestic BIPOC neighborhoods or shipped off to the global South. 
         The landfills in other countries have much less regulation. 
         This has many negative side effects, such as microplastics leaching into natural resources like water and soil, garments clogging drainage systems causing flooding and the spread of waterborne illness, and the burning of excess textiles which pollute the air and cause cardiovascular disease. 
         It is not necessary to produce clothing at this volume. Compared to just 15 years ago, the average wardrobe size has increased by 60%. 
         Even with this increased wardrobe size, clothes are only being worn about half as many times as they were in the same timeframe.
          On top of this, clothing production doubled globally from 2000-2015. The shift towards outsourcing textile labor to other countries means that the conditions for the workers were disregarded since it was out of the public eye. 
          This means that workers can be paid non-living wages to make cheap clothing that doesn’t last, requiring people to buy more clothes than they need. The average garment in the US is worn only seven times. 
          This “fast fashion” model started in the late 1980s with Zara, but now it has become almost a standard in the fashion industry. Most clothes constructed under this business model are made of polyester, putting more microplastics into the environment. 
          This model of treating clothes as almost disposable at the expense of workers overseas has not been the historical norm and should be disrupted.</p>

      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>Activists and experts support the mission of buy-nothing platforms to help reduce the problem of textile waste.
         Buy-nothing groups give a second life to items such as clothes. These groups reduce the use of single-use plastics in packaging and reduce ‘wishcycling’ (a term referring to when people accidentally send unrecyclable items to recycling plants), 
         and our group will aim to localize swaps to reduce carbon emissions from shipping. 
         These groups additionally reduce excessive overproduction in fast fashion, and complicated supply chains, and promote sustainable living and community connections. 
         Buy-nothing groups help bring awareness to our habits of consumption, and the effect of textile waste in landfills on the environment and educate people on sustainable disposal alternatives that benefit us in the process.
          Our product will provide a platform for users to post clothes they no longer need, search for clothes they are looking for, and unlike alternative apps out there, focus on location-based meetups to avoid shipping and promote mutual aid efforts and community connection.</p>
